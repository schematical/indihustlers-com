Stay and chat after, or not. It's up to you.

# FAQ:
## What is the difference between the Free and Paid versions?
Right now while we are getting started we are offering 8 spots in the first cohort for free. After that we are looking at a $19/month.
## When do you meet?

Right now Monday - Friday 10am ET but this is subject to change as the group grows

## Is This In Person?
No, this is 100% virtual. I suppose you could meet up with other group members if you were interested in doing so. I am not going to stop you.

## What does the application process look like?
Right now you fill out the signup form then we will reach out to you to do a virtual face to face meeting. From there we will diliberate and let you know.

## How Do We Meet?
Discord! We have voice channels with video enabled that will facilitate our meetings.

## Will The Meetings Be Recorded:
Possibly, but we will 100% let you know beforehand. We are going to experiment, perhaps starting by livestreaming one day a week to help promote the group and any of our projects that the public might find interesting.
